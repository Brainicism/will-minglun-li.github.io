				<strong>Welcome to my About Me page!</strong>
				<br><br>
				My legal name is Ming Lun Li, but I prefer to be called Will as that's what people call me/know me as after I came to Canada. I'm also a self-motivated and dedicated software engineer/programmer.
				<br><br>
				I study Computer Engineering (Honours, Co-op) at the <a href = "https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/"> University of Waterloo</a> and I am always excited to learn about new technology and solving fun/challenging problems. I am very interested in web development, game making/development, and a variety of other software engineering/development fields.
				<br><br>
				I have always aspired to become a programmer who can eventually earn a living developing software that people use and love. I first started programming in my grade 10 computer science course where I learned and gained an extensive amount of knowledge in C++. I later went on and learned Python, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Java on my own before high school ended. I am looking to learn and master a lot more languages in the future. The source code for some of my projects can be found on <a href = "https://github.com/Will-MingLun-Li">my GitHub</a>.
				<br><br>
				If you have any questions about me, potential job offers, or if you want to learn more about me, please don't be afraid to reach me at <a href = "mailto:will.liatw@gmail.com"> will.liatw@gmail.com</a>!
