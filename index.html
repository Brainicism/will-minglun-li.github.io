			<p> I made this website from scratch using the knowledge I had in June and knowledge I learned until I finished it in September. Every time I learn something that can improve this website, I would try my best to include it to make it better. Althought this is somewhat of the "finished" product, it doesn't mean I won't be learning/trying to improve it. I will still try to display whatever I learn in the future on this website and keep it updated frequently. </p>
