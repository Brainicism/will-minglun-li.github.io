# Will-MingLun-Li.github.io

It is my personal website that I would like to use to demonstrate my knowledge and experience with. I have worked on this website since mid-June and recently finished in late-August with about 15 days of "break" during July. I made this website completely from scratch with the knowledge I learned from mostly Codecademy.

If you want to use the source code, feel free to do so, that's one of the reasons why I shared it here on GitHub. I looked at other people's websites for inspiration on how to structure my site and took what I think looked good on each one to form what I have here. I think looking at other people's projects is a good way to learn, and if looking at my website assists you in building your own, that will make me very happy. 

So far, my website only contains 3 main sections: education, experience, and projects. I will try to add whatever I think will fit in the future, suggestions will be much appreciated. 

The website will work on mobile devices, however, please use a computer for a better experience. Although I added mobile and smaller screen resolutions, it comes out a bit weird on iOS devices such as iPad and iPhone, I don't know why it happens and I will try my best to fix that issue.
