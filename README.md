# Will-MingLun-Li.github.io

This is my personal website that I would like to use to demonstrate my knowledge and experience with. 

If you want to use the source code, feel free to do so, that's one of the main reasons why I shared it here on GitHub. I looked at other people's websites for inspiration on how to structure my site and took what I think looked good on each one to form what I have here. I think looking at other people's projects is a good way to learn, and if looking at my website assists you in building your own, that will make me very happy. 

The website will work on mobile devices, however, please use a computer for a better experience. Although I added mobile and smaller screen resolutions, some features simply doesn't display on mobile devices. I will try my best to fix the issues and make the website more mobile-friendly.
